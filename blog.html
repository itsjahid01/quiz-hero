          What is the difference between map, forEach, filter and find?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="text-green-500 text-lg font-bold">Ans:</span> The first
          difference between map() and forEach() is the returning value. The
          forEach() method returns undefined and map() returns a new array with
          the transformed elements.Map() method does not change the original
          array.ForEach() method is not executed for empty elements. The
          filter() method is used to filter all the elements.The find() method
          is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected
          element.The filter() method does not change the original array.The
          find() does not change the original array. The filter() and find()
          method does not execute the function for empty elements.

            What is the difference between local storage , session storage and cookie?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="text-green-500 text-lg font-bold">Ans:</span> Local
          storage is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger amounts of
          data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is
          closed. Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will
          need to access later, such as offline data. Session storage is similar
          to cookies, but the data is only stored for the current session. This
          means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser.
          Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as
          login credentials. Cookies are the oldest and most well-known
          mechanism. They are simple to use and well supported by browsers.
          However, they are limited to 4KB of data and are often used to store
          data that is not sensitive, such as user preferences.

            What is Event loop and how it works?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="text-green-500 text-lg font-bold">Ans:</span> Event loop is just a guardian who keeps a good communication with Call Stack and Callback Queue. It checks if the call stack is free, then lets know the callback queue. Then Callback queue passes the callback function to Call stack to be executed. When all the callback functions are executed, the call stack is out and global execution context is free.
